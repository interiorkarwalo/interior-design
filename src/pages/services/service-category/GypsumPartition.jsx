            <h3>Why Gypsum?</h3>
            <p>
              Gypsum is a lightweight internal wall technology with superior
              performance compared to traditional brick walls. In various
              residential, commercial, and industrial building applications,
              gypsum is quickly replacing other materials as the material of
              choice.
              <br />
              Four to five times less time is required for gypsum installation
              than for masonry work. Brick walls use 95% more water than drywall
              construction. Gypsum plasterboard, the main component of drywall,
              makes it 100% recyclable. These characteristics result in a
              decrease in material, energy, and labour, which lowers prices.

            <h3>Fire-Resistant Walls</h3>
            <p>
              A fire-rated drywall helps to contain the fire inside the
              partition and stops smoke from leaking into other spaces.
              Fire-rated gypsum drywall has glass fibre reinforcing and around
              21% of its weight in water that has been chemically mixed. Water
              slowly releases steam as it comes into contact with fire, delaying
              heat transfer.

            <h3>Why do you need a Gypsum partition wall?</h3>
            <div>
              <h4>Economical installation</h4>
              <p>
                Drywall not only saves time but also guarantees affordable
                installation. For a few days or longer, you aren't required to
                hire many individuals and can eventually save a significant sum
                of money that would have been spent on installing a brick wall.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Lowers the construction cost</h4>
              <p>
                Every new cement-based building you develop adds weight to the
                entire structure. It is as much as ten times lighter if you use
                gypsum plasterboard in its place. As a result, it saves on
                shipping raw materials and adds structural costs.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Sound reduction</h4>
              <p>
                The majority of gypsum plasterboards comprise many layers made
                of various materials. The effectiveness of the sound decreases
                with each layer that it passes. For instance, it also provides
                unparalleled beauty and is ideal for various acoustic
                requirements.
