            <h3>Why Gypsum?</h3>
            <p>
              Gypsum is a lightweight internal wall technology with superior
              performance compared to traditional brick walls. In various
              residential, commercial, and industrial building applications,
              gypsum is quickly replacing other materials as the material of
              choice.
              <br />
              Four to five times less time is required for gypsum installation
              than for masonry work. Brick walls use 95% more water than drywall
              construction. Gypsum plasterboard, the main component of drywall,
              makes it 100% recyclable. These characteristics result in a
              decrease in material, energy, and labour, which lowers prices.
