            <p>
              We start by planning the building's physical layout before

              essentially give the living and working area life.

            <h3>Fire-Resistant Walls</h3>
            <p>
              A fire-rated drywall helps to contain the fire inside the
              partition and stops smoke from leaking into other spaces.
              Fire-rated gypsum drywall has glass fibre reinforcing and around
              21% of its weight in water that has been chemically mixed. Water
              slowly releases steam as it comes into contact with fire, delaying
              heat transfer.
              <br />
              Our experienced staff has worked on projects for County,
              Government, National, domestic, entertainment, medical, retail,
              F&B, historic restoration, and more. We also have approximately 5+
              years of total expertise in construction. A testament to our
              dedication to safety is that our team of over 50 people has an
              Experience Modification Rate higher than the industry norm.

            <h3>Why do you need a Gypsum partition wall?</h3>
            <div>
              <h4>Economical installation</h4>
              <p>
                Drywall not only saves time but also guarantees affordable
                installation. For a few days or longer, you aren't required to
                hire many individuals and can eventually save a significant sum
                of money that would have been spent on installing a brick wall.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Lowers the construction cost</h4>
              <p>
                Every new cement-based building you develop adds weight to the
                entire structure. It is as much as ten times lighter if you use
                gypsum plasterboard in its place. As a result, it saves on
                shipping raw materials and adds structural costs.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Sound reduction</h4>
              <p>
                The majority of gypsum plasterboards comprise many layers made
                of various materials. The effectiveness of the sound decreases
                with each layer that it passes. For instance, it also provides
                unparalleled beauty and is ideal for various acoustic
                requirements.
                <br />
                So, do you want to get a consultation from our expert? If yes,
                you can talk with our professional contractors and make some
                best changes in your commercial & industrial space.
